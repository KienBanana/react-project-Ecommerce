            Users with access to the Internet can use many digital mediums, such
            as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and Email etc. Through Digital
            communications it creates a Multi-communication channel where
            information can be quickly exchanged around the world by anyone
            without any regard to whom they are.[28] Social segregation plays no

            communication and information being wide spread instead to a
            selective audience.{" "}
